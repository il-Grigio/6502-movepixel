# 6502-movepixel
A simple experiment of coding a MOS6502 CPU, in this example we are able to light up a pixel in green and we can move it around using the directional arrows

pip install necroassembler

create a .bin file like this: necro_6502.exe .\movepixel.S .\name_of_the_file.bin

You may need https://github.com/rdeioris/dummy6502/releases/tag/20221018 to simulate it.

Now open the name_of_the_file.bin in the dummy6502 program.
